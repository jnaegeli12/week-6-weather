# Week 6 Homework: Weather Dashboard
An app displaying the weather forecast for American cities.

## Function
When the app loads, the user is presented with an input field and invited to enter a city to get a weather forecast. On clicking the submit button, a section for today's weather appears with an icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. Below that, a five-day forecast on cards appears with the dates, hi & lo temps, humidity, and an icon.

In addition to the weather forecasts, a button is created with the city name just entered. Each time the user enters a city, a new button appears with that city, thereby creating a search history of sorts. The buttons are supposed to be clickable, retrieving weather data for those cities again, but I could not make the function connect to the new buttons.

## Tools Used
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- OpenWeatherMap API
